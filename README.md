<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sergey Nazarov</h1>

I'm .NET software engineer and mentor from Moscow.  
I'm always open to collaboration, so feel free to text me. I'm interested in fintech and gambling projects generally, but you can offer any domain.  
I'm trying to evolve my skills and always learning something new. My hobby is writing telegram bots, for instance [Flea](https://cutt.ly/Aewci2fj), [Noty](https://t.me/N8tyBot), [MyCbrBot](https://t.me/MyCbr_Bot).  
Currently, I'm leading team of dotnet engineers and teaching students at indoor programming school.
